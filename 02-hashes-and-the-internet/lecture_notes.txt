what happens when I go to this website?

go to https://pointerpointer.com/

go to https://www.reddit.com/r/awww

go to https://www.reddit.com/r/awww/.json

this .json page is the data behind the non json page
* Show the difference between them
* Show how they are related
* Mention what json is and that it looks like a hash
* talk about chrome extension

What does JSON look like?

a web browser is just a client to access this information.
It's some software that someone wrote, Like excel, to use this data and interact with it.

We are going to go from a web browser client (Chrome)
to our own client that is written in ruby and we are going to make it ourselves
Because, we are programmers

check out our gems (rest-client gem github)
check out how to use rest-client (get request)


talk through install gems

explore rest-client with https://www.reddit.com/r/awww/.json URL

show response of rest client
show .class of rest client

check out response.body


talk about json gem

google json ruby gem github

pass the response.body into JSON.parse()

this is an api (reddit.json is, for example)

an api is an application programmable interface

does anyone want to take a stab at what that means?

talk about & quickly show Starwars API (https://swapi.co/)

Talk about google books api

Build google books api app.
* ask user to get information they want to search for
* Make a request to google books API
* display all the book results that come back but only:
  * Show title
  * Show Desc
  * Show Author



  Search for "clowns"

  Search for "hotdog water"

Use JSON.parse

lets look at one book

lets pull out the info in that one book

lets loop through all the books

lets decorate them

use pry

check out things using .class
check out things using .methods
check out things using .keys
check out things using .values
look at the .json url from the browser

go through errors with .join
do some error handling for books with no authors


QUESTIONS??
