## Learning goals

* Contrast imperative and declarative programming
* Describe the purpose of the virtual DOM
* Compare the virtual DOM to the actual DOM
* Describe the component hierarchy using the terms root, parent, and child
* Identify components from a wireframe and draw out the flow of information
* Create a React app that renders "Hello, World!" to the screen
* Define the term prop in the context of React
* List the types of data that can be passed as props
* Explain the benefits or drawbacks of using the tool `create-react-app`
* Create a React app that renders a container, one list, and five list items

## What was hard about vanilla JS?
* EVERYTHINGGGG!!!! >:(
* Sloppiness (w/o OO)
  - hard to organize code
* Very fickle (picky picky js)
* WAT is async?..
* What about that DOM thing?
* Error messages are LIARS
* Gotta learn new js all the time
